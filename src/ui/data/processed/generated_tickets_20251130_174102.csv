Missing Feedback Data Files - Unable to Analyze Feedback,"The files containing user feedback located at data/raw/app_store_reviews.csv and data/raw/support_emails.csv are currently inaccessible or do not exist. As a result, it is impossible to perform analysis on user reviews or support emails to generate actionable tickets or assign severity and impact. Please provide the correct file paths or upload the raw feedback data to enable further processing.",Blocker,High,"['data-access', 'feedback-analysis', 'blocker']",N/A
Request for Correct File Paths or Raw Feedback Data,"To proceed with extracting feature requests, bug reports, and other feedback from user data, the correct file paths or the raw feedback data itself must be supplied. Currently, the lack of access to data/raw/app_store_reviews.csv and data/raw/support_emails.csv prevents any ticket creation based on user feedback. Ensuring data availability is critical to continue the feedback handling and backlog prioritization workflow.",Task,High,"['data-provision', 'dependency', 'feedback-processing']",N/A
